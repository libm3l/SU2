1. Start server, include path

   Server_Main.out --port 31000 --input_file Definition_File_SU2  --show

2. execute structural solver and SU2, order of execution does not play role as long as server
   is executed first

   ./Elast_Solver.out  IP portno

   IP is an address of computer where Server runs (in most cases it will be   localhost)
   portno  0 is numbre of port which Server binds   (see  --port 31000 in example line executing Server)

   mpirun -np Nproc  SU2_CFD config file



   NOTE: both Elast_Solver and SU2_CFD need to know IP address and port number of the Server!!!!
